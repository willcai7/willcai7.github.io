I am a Ph.D. student in Math at [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/home). My advisors are [Michael Lindsey](https://quantumtative.github.io/) and [Peter L. Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/). I obtained my M.A. in Statistics at [University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/), and my B.S. in Math at [Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/).

### Research

My research focuses on creating efficient algorithms to address real-world challenges and providing a deep understanding of the theoretical principles behind them. By connecting theoretical foundations with practical applications, my work aims to advance both academic knowledge and technological innovation.

I specialize in optimizations for high-dimensional problems, particularly in **electronic structure theory** and **machine learning**.
